Links to resources I find useful/entertaining. I collect these here so that they are within reach for me and for others. It's also a form of exhibitionism to give readers a picture about me through the things I like and find interesting.

Keep in mind, that on this site I focus on programming and cybersecurity. So below you won't find anything related to my other personal interests (e. g. philosophy or gaming). Those will get their own place â€“ in time.

I don't have a category for this, but the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) is an invaluable asset when I face a problem, so I must mention it before anything else.

## News on Cybersecurity, Programming and Technology

The following newspapers/blogs all produce quality content. Most of the time you can get the specific RSS feeds from them to save time. I try to orient myself in the changing world of technology with the help of these.
