## Welcome to my blog

I am a web developer, mostly using technologies like Node.js, TypeScript, React and Svelte. I consider myself security- and privacy-conscious in a sense that I try to develop with a focus on security: writing secure APIs, authentication and file upload solutions, protecting against SQL injections, command injections, etc. And privacy-conscious in a sense that I try to use open-source or privacy-friendly alternatives when there is one (e. g. [CloudFlare Turnstile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/)) and avoid using trackers, analytics, Google fonts, etc. When I have the opportunity, of course, not in work where we rely on analytics. There's not much to do about that.

I am continuously improving my knowledge in the areas of web development and web security, whether it is learning how to make specific things in the browser, how to write secure and maintainable APIs in TypeScript or identifying how web applications get exploited. Currently fascinated with real-time technologies (WebSockets, WebRTC) and Rust, so in my free time I am focusing on learning those and making some basic projects to solidify my skills.

My main areas of interest are: 1, web development 2, low level programming and 3, cybersecurity.

My purpose with this blog is to write about the stuff I am learning or about anything that interests me and IT-related. I find it easier to make things stick when I have to articulate them so that others can understand it. This site is a documentation about my journey and about me. Nowadays I am active on **Frontend Masters**, feel free to [check out my profile](https://frontendmasters.com/u/mahlstrom/).

I studied philosophy (have a BA in Liberal Arts), and switched to IT during my MA-studies. Currently **working** in a hybrid position **as a system administrator** (Windows, Microsoft 365) **and web developer**.
