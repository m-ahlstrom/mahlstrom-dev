## Welcome to my blog

I am a web developer, mostly using technologies like Node.js, TypeScript, React and Svelte. I am continuously improving my knowledge in the areas of web development and web security, whether it is learning how to make specific things in the browser, how to write secure and maintainable APIs in TypeScript or identifying how web applications get exploited. Currently I'm focusing on learning testing and writing tests for React and Svelte for applications.

My main areas of interest are: 1, web development 2, low level programming and 3, cybersecurity.

My purpose with this blog is to write about the stuff I am learning or about anything that interests me and IT-related. I find it easier to make things stick when I have to articulate them so that others can understand it. This site is a documentation about my journey and about me. Nowadays I am active on **Frontend Masters**, feel free to [check out my profile](https://frontendmasters.com/u/mahlstrom/).

I studied philosophy (have a BA in Liberal Arts), and switched to IT during my MA-studies. Currently **working** in a hybrid position **as a system administrator** (Windows, Microsoft 365) **and web developer**.
