These are the projects I have built so far. This list contains only my hobby projects, nothing work-related. Ordered by date of creation from newest to oldest.

## 2024

[Note Taking CLI in Node.js](https://github.com/m-ahlstrom/small-javascript-projects/tree/main/note-taking-cli-node)

A note taking CLI application built with **Node.js**. Create notes, read or delete notes, and **launch a web server** to see the notes in a browser. The notes are **saved to the file system** inside db.json. Small test coverage with **Jest**.

[Coffe Masters - Vanilla JS](https://github.com/m-ahlstrom/small-javascript-projects/tree/main/coffeemasters-vanilla)

A **singe page application** (**SPA**) written entirely in vanilla **JavaScript**. Utilized **SPA routing**, **web components**, the **shadow DOM** and **reactive programming** with proxies.

[Microfrontends with React](https://github.com/m-ahlstrom/microfrontends-with-react)

A GitHub monorepo with different frontend projects (React, Vue) following the **microfrontends architecture pattern**. Utilized **Webpack** and the **Module Federation plugin** to make each project independent. With every push the **GitHub Actions** run, rebuilding the appropriate project, pushing my modifications to **AWS S3** and **CloudFront**, thus it instantly becomes visible.

[CMS from Scrath in PHP](https://github.com/m-ahlstrom/cms-from-scratch-php)

A basic CMS built with **PHP** from scratch. Register a user, login, logout. Create, read, edit or delete articles. Publish articles that have no publish date yet. Upload images to articles, delete article images. Send e-mail through a contact form with **PHPMailer**.

## 2023

[Yelp Camp Europe v1](https://github.com/m-ahlstrom/yelp-camp-europe)

A campground booking app built with **Node.js**, **Express.js** and **MongoDB**. This project is currently **in development**. Everything is functional: the basics of the authentication system, campground creation, reviews. What it needs is a little polishing, adding extra features. Deployed to **Vercel**, [check it out in action](https://yelp-camp-europe.vercel.app/).
